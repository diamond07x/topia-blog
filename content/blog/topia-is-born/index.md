## Quarantine
In this time of quarantine, we wondered if we might use emergent technologies to bring people together to share authentic human connection and experiences with one another.  Our team has been experimenting with these technologies and contemplating building an immersive experience platform for many years.  We quickly realized that we could build an oasis of human connection that would be an alternative to video software that was built for business meetings. It would be accessible by anyone with a web browser and webcam and we decided to call it Topia.

## World Builders
We also wanted to manifest a toolset where anyone could become a world builder and create unique spaces that encourage people to explore, dance, laugh and cry.  We wanted to bring the beauty and interactivity of the real world into Topia by making it easy to create experience plugins like art, games, embedded audio & video, clickable links, and portals between worlds. And we wanted event producers and community managers to have everything they needed to plan, host and communicate with their participants.

## Our First Event
We began building Topia in May and we had our first event a few weeks after the first line of code was written.  The positive response from attendees at our first two events was remarkable and provided us with the validation we needed to go all-in.
