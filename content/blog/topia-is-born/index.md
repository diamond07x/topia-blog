title: Topia is Born

description: We realized that we could build an oasis of human connection that would be an alternative to video software that was built for business meetings. It would be accessible by anyone with a web browser and webcam and we decided to call it Topia.

## Origin Story
Topia started because we wanted an easy way to connect face-to-face with people around the world in a way that is fun (doesn’t feel like work) and feels natural.

Like many people around the world, we looked to online tools to connect with others at the beginning of the pandemic. We turned to traditional video conferencing to connect with our communities but it left us wanting more. We quickly grew tired of zoom fatigue, feeling trapped on calls where only the loudest person talks, and using business technology to socialize.
 
We knew there had to be a better way to bring people together online. And, with our team’s deep expertise in gaming, distributed systems, immersive technologies, and webRTC we decided to build it.

### Why
At Topia, we provide customizable spaces to bring people together for human interactions and unique experiences that build meaningful relationships.

We are a deeply social species. While it is easier than ever to stay in touch, existing tools don’t help facilitate the authentic connection that we crave<sup>1</sup>. In a 2D context (email, text, facebook) we miss out on the **nuances of human communication**. We lose cues from **body language, tone of voice, or context**. Video chat, alone, gets us one step closer but it lacks the spatial context....

### How
Topia combines the simplicity of walking around with the serendipity of creating new friendships. We give users the agency to move around the world so they can seamlessly walk in and out of conversations - just like in person. We empower world owners to create a unique world for their guests by adding assets from our library, uploading their own art or creating experiences with embedded games or adding audio & video, clicking links, or portals between worlds.

We hosted our first public event in May 2020. The event culminated in a memorial ceremony and temple burn (as part of Remote Burn). For many, it was the first time since the beginning of the pandemic that they were able to connect with others in an authentic way.

<sup>1</sup> Research shows that real (as opposed to casual) relationships require at least occasional face-to-face interactions - it turns out, seeing the whites of someone's eyes is important.
